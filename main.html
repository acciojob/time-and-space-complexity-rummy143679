	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the input size (n) grows. It helps estimate how efficient an algorithm is, especially for large inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures how much extra memory (space) an algorithm needs relative to the input size (n).It tells you how much additional space your algorithm uses besides the input data. Like time complexity, itâ€™s expressed in Big O notation: O(1), O(n), etc.</p>
