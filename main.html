	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. It helps estimate how efficient an algorithm is, especially for large inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures how much extra memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size O(n). It tells you how much additional space your algorithm uses besides the input data. Like time complexity, its expressed in Big O notations.</p>
